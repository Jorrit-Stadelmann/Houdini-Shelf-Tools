# Houdini-Shelf-Tools

This repository is a collection of my Houdini shelf tools.

# How to install:
1. Copy .py files to your Houdini script folder.
2. Copy the the .shelf file to your toolbar folder (/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/houdini/[houdini version]/toolbar/
3. Edit the newly copied .shelf file and change the path for the scripts to match your script folder path
4. Restart Houdini
